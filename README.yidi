2/15:
- I set up the Spring Boot dependencies and built a dummy endpoint to learn how to use the framework.

Notes: We initially had planned on building an API stub at this time, but decided it would be unnecessary given how simple
it is to set up routes in Spring Boot, and that we weren't working on any features which depended on it

2/22:
- I stubbed out the /register endpoint this week. We planned on building out this feature fully, but missed this goal due
to a miscommunication in Asana. This might set back our integration testing a little bit, but we have the logic for authenticating
tokens done ahead of schedule, so we should still be on course.
- We had a productive discussion regarding the interface between the business logic (which we will designate as controller)
and the API. We decided that the API can handle basic sanity checks on the parameters, and that we would overload the API instead
of the controller in cases where we might want some flexibility (such as logging in with email || username)

Notes: Had a lot of trouble working out kinks in configurations and framework issues. Still don't have things fully working with
IntelliJ but managed to find workarounds for everything in the terminal.

3/1:
- I wired up the /register endpoint this week, and also implemented the /login and /checkAuthToken endpoints
- I wrote unit tests for all of these endpoints. If something breaks it's not my fault!
- Next week it's my turn to do integration tests.

3/8:
- Added endpoints for /resetPassword and /getPasswordResetToken
- I think we can use the setup I'd been doing for unit testing (sans the mocking) for our integration tests
- Integration tests: next time, I promise!

3/22:
- We tried to do integration testing this week, but it required us to understand some of the parts
of Spring that we had been handwaving over before. With the essay hanging over our heads this week,
none of us really managed to figure it out. We'll try to tackle it again next week, but if we
still don't have any success, then we'll just stick to testing the system by hand, and moving on with
building the rest of our features.

3/29:
- Finally got integration testing to work
- Briefly had some trouble from repeatedly setting up the embedded db, but solved it by creating a
test suite for the integration tests which share the setup code
- Added the API endpoints for TOTP
- This completes our core functionality. Anything else from here is icing on the cake

4/5:
- I focused on containerizing this week so we could ship a packaged application that users could deploy in one click
- Spent a lot of time fighting configuration files
- Ran into trouble containerizing the application with the db it needs. First I tried to put both in the
same container, but eventually realized that it's not easy to combine two containers
- Had some trouble because had to learn docker-compose, which I had never encountered before. It can help
spin up separate containers for db and application. It makes configuring each one cleaner, but there's some
trickiness in the orchestration.
- Currently have a non-functioning docker setup, but I'm confident I'll get there soon.

4/12:
- Brian and I got the docker-compose to work. The only difference from last week's file was that we needed to change the hostname for the database. We spent an hour debugging this one line issue. Super frustrating - wish this were better documented! 
- Worked on the demo app that Mark and Brian started last week. I built the register page and did a refactoring to use Flask's message flashing feature to pass messages between routes. 

4/19:
- We're done with almost everything at this point. This week is just tying up some loose ends
- I fixed some tests that were broken from adding the throttling and made a change to the demo app

4/26:
- We were basically done at this point. Updated the docker/compose setup so that you can download just the 2 docker files + 3 config files and the Dockerfile will build a container with your configurations and you don't have to touch the repo.
- Also worked on presentation/report this week
